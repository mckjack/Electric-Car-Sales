## Proposed findings and a hypothesis of results (i.e. business problem contextualized with data driven results)
Questions we hope to answer in our project are:
1. Did rising/falling gas prices have any effect on electric car sales in the US?
2. Did answer to #1 vary significantly from different states?
3. Can we predict electric car sales over the next year based on the 2 datasets?
4. Can we predict crude oil prices over the next year?
5. ???

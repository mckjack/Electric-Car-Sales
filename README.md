## 2. Github repo and everyone has merged with the main branch at least once
Everyone in our project team has merged to the main branch: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100737452/179632030-62c03404-f0aa-421b-b06b-240559ba574a.png)

## 3. Proposed findings and a hypothesis of results (i.e. business problem contextualized with data driven results)
Using the following datasets...
1. Crude oil prices
2. Electric car sales

Questions we hope to answer in our project are:
1. Did rising/falling gas prices have any effect on electric car sales in the US? 
2. Did answer to #1 vary significantly from different states?
3. Can we predict electric car sales over the next year based on the 2 datasets?
4. Can we predict crude oil prices over the next year?

We selected this topic due to rising gas prices and we wanted to study how it impacts consumer purchases for automobiles.  Our hypothesis is that the gas prices do impact consumer choices.
